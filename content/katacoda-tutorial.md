*mulhern, Stratis Team*

We would like to thank Red Hat for hosting a Katacoda tutorial for Stratis at
[lab.redhat.com/stratis]. We hope that the tutorial will provide an easy and
pleasant introduction to Stratis for new users.

Please note that the tutorial does not include the latest work on encryption,
as it makes use of a prior version of Stratis, 2.0.0.

<!-- more -->

We hope to post links to additional Katacoda tutorials covering more advanced
or recent Stratis functionality as they become available.
